Student Result Management System

Project Overview

The Student Result Management System is a simple software application designed to assist lecturers in recording, managing, and processing student academic scores efficiently. The system allows lecturers to enter student scores and automatically calculate totals, averages, and grades, thereby reducing manual effort and minimizing errors associated with result computation.

This project was developed as part of the SEN 201 course requirement to demonstrate a clear understanding and practical application of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The system is implemented using the Python programming language and operates through a command-line interface.

Problem Statement

In many academic environments, student results are still calculated manually. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially when handling multiple students and courses. There is a need for a simple system that can automate result calculation and improve accuracy and efficiency.

Project Objectives

The objectives of the Student Result Management System are to:
	•	Allow lecturers to store student scores
	•	Automatically calculate total scores and averages
	•	Reduce errors in result computation
	•	Provide a simple and easy-to-use result processing system
	•	Demonstrate the practical stages of the SDLC

⸻

Scope of the System

The system focuses on:
	•	Accepting student scores as input
	•	Performing automatic calculations
	•	Displaying results clearly in the terminal

The system does not currently include advanced features such as databases or graphical user interfaces, but it is designed to allow future improvements.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. Planning Phase

During the planning phase, the need for an automated student result processing system was identified. The goal was to create a simple, reliable system that could assist lecturers in calculating results accurately while demonstrating SDLC concepts.

⸻

2. Requirements Analysis

Functional Requirements
	•	Input student scores
	•	Calculate total scores
	•	Calculate average scores
	•	Display results clearly

Non-Functional Requirements
	•	The system should be easy to use
	•	The system should execute quickly
	•	The system should produce accurate results

⸻

3. System Design

The system was designed as a command-line application using Python. The design includes:
	•	Input collection for student scores
	•	Internal calculation logic
	•	Output display of results

All variable names and system components used in the design were maintained consistently during implementation.

⸻

4. Implementation

The Student Result Management System was implemented using Python. The program accepts student scores, calculates the total and average, and displays the results to the user. The implementation strictly follows the design specifications defined in the earlier SDLC stages.

⸻

5. Testing

Testing was carried out by running the system with different input values to ensure:
	•	Scores are correctly accepted
	•	Calculations are accurate
	•	Output matches expected results

Multiple test cases were used to verify that the system behaves correctly under normal conditions.
Deployment
The Student Result Management System was deployed by pushing the source code to a public GitHub repository, making it accessible online for users and evaluators. Deployment through GitHub ensures version control, accessibility, and easy evaluation of the project.
Users can run the system locally by downloading the source code and executing it using a Python interpreter.
Maintenance
The system can be maintained and improved by:
	•	Adding support for multiple students
	•	Storing results in a file or database
	•	Improving input validation and security
	•	Extending the system to include grade classification
	•	Converting the system into a full web-based application

These improvements will enhance the system’s functionality and usability over time.

Documentation

This project is fully documented using the README file in the GitHub repository. The documentation explains:
	•	System requirements
	•	Design approach
	•	Implementation details
	•	Testing process
	•	Deployment method
	•	Maintenance strategies

The documentation ensures that users and evaluators can easily understand, use, and improve the system.

Conclusion

The Student Result Management System successfully demonstrates how software can be developed systematically using the Software Development Life Cycle. By automating student result calculations, the system improves accuracy, efficiency, and reliability. This project serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements and real-world academic applications.
